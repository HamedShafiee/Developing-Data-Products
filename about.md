## Probability Distribution Generation, Plotting & Calculation  

This Shiny App does 4 thing:
1- generates 3 types of probability distribution (Normal,Poison,Uniform) based on user provided information.
1-1 for normal distribution:
    -user determines the length of the sample for random data generation
    -user determines the mean & standard deviation of the distribution
1-2 for poison distribution:
    -user determines the length of the sample for random data generation
    -user determines the lambda rate of the distribution
1-3 for uniform distribtion:
    -user determines the length of the sample for random data generation
    -user determines the min & max of the distribution

2- Plots the histogram of the distribution and fits a smooth line to show how it is close to a normal distribution
3- provides a summary of randomly generated data for the distribution
4- claculates the probability of having data in a range based on each of the chosen distributions
    -user determines the range
